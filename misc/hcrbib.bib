@article{Chakrabartty1994,
abstract = {Helix propensities of the amino acids have been measured in alanine‐based peptides in the absence of helix‐stabilizing side‐chain interactions. Fifty‐eight peptides have been studied. A modified form of the Lifson‐Roig theory for the helix‐coil transition, which includes helix capping (Doig AJ, Chakrabartty A, Klingler TM, Baldwin RL, 1994, Biochemistry 33:3396‐3403), was used to analyze the results. Substitutions were made at various positions of homologous helical peptides. Helix‐capping interactions were found to contribute to helix stability, even when the substitution site was not at the end of the peptide. Analysis of our data with the original Lifson‐Roig theory, which neglects capping effects, does not produce as good a fit to the experimental data as does analysis with the modified Lifson‐Roig theory. At 0 °C, Ala is a strong helix former, Leu and Arg are helix‐indifferent, and all other amino acids are helix breakers of varying severity. Because Ala has a small side chain that cannot interact significantly with other side chains, helix formation by Ala is stabilized predominantly by the backbone (“peptide H‐bonds”). The implication for protein folding is that formation of peptide H‐bonds can largely offset the unfavorable entropy change caused by fixing the peptide backbone. The helix propensities of most amino acids oppose folding; consequently, the majority of isolated helices derived from proteins are unstable, unless specific side‐chain interactions stabilize them.

abstract = {Liquid-like membraneless organelles form via multiple, weak interactions between biomolecules. The resulting condensed states constitute novel solvent environments inside eukaryotic cells that partition biomolecules and may favour particular biochemical reactions. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to attractive interactions, repulsive electrostatic interactions modulate condensate properties. We find that net charge modulates the formation, morphology and solvent properties of model Ddx4 condensates in cells and in vitro and that a net negative charge is conserved across germ cell-specific Ddx4 orthologues. This conserved net charge provides a sensitivity to multivalent cations that is not observed in somatic paralogues. The disfavouring effect of a net negative charge in Ddx4 orthologues appears to be offset by increased charge patterning, indicating that fine tuning of both attractive and repulsive interactions can create responsive solvent environments inside biomolecular condensates..

abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem'8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

@article{Kumar1998,
abstract = {Understanding the sequence-structure relationships in globular proteins is important for reliable protein structure prediction and de novo design. Using a database of 1131 $\alpha$-helices with nonidentical sequences from 205 nonhomologous globular protein chains, we have analyzed structural and sequence characteristics of $\alpha$-helices. We find that geometries of more than 99% of all the $\alpha$-helices can be simply characterised as being linear, curved, or kinked. Only a small number of $\alpha$-helices ($\sim$4%) show sharp localized bends in their middle regions, and thus are classified as kinked. Approximately three-fourths ($\sim$73%) of the $\alpha$-helices in globular proteins show varying degrees of smooth curvature, with a mean radius of curvature of 65 ± 33 {\AA}; longer helices are less curved. Computation of helix accessibility to the solvent indicates that nearly two-thirds of the helices ($\sim$66%) are largely buried in the protein core, and the length and geometry of the helices are not correlated with their location in the protein globule. However, the amino acid compositions and propensities of individual amino acids to occur in $\alpha$-helices vary with their location in the protein globule, their geometries, and their lengths. In particular, Gln, Glu, Lys, and Arg are found mote often in helices near the surface of globular proteins. Interestingly, kinks often seem to occur in regions where amino acids with low helix propensities (e.g., $\beta$-branched and aromatic residues) cluster together, in addition to those associated with the, occurrence of proline residues. Hence the propensities of individual amino acids to occur in a given secondary structure depend not only on conformation but also on its length, geometry, and location in the protein globule.},

@article{Lytle2019,
abstract = {Charged polymers are ubiquitous in biological systems because electrostatic interactions can drive complicated structure formation and respond to environmental parameters such as ionic strength and pH. In these systems, function emerges from sophisticated molecular design; for example, intrinsically disordered proteins leverage specific sequences of monomeric charges to control the formation and function of intracellular compartments known as membraneless organelles. The role of a charged monomer sequence in dictating the strength of electrostatic interactions remains poorly understood despite extensive evidence that sequence is a powerful tool biology uses to tune soft materials. In this article, we use a combination of theory, experiment, and simulation to establish the physical principles governing sequence-driven control of electrostatic interactions. We predict how arbitrary sequences of charge give rise to drastic changes in electrostatic interactions and correspondingly phase behavior. We generalize a transfer matrix formalism that describes a phase separation phenomenon known as "complex coacervation" and provide a theoretical framework to predict the phase behavior of charge sequences. This work thus provides insights into both how charge sequence is used in biology and how it could be used to engineer properties of synthetic polymer systems.},

abstract = {There are multiple definitions for low complexity regions (LCRs) in protein sequences, with all of them broadly considering LCRs as regions with fewer amino acid types compared to an average composition. Following this view, LCRs can also be defined as regions showing composition bias. In this critical review, we focus on the definition of sequence complexity of LCRs and their connection with structure. We present statistics and methodological approaches that measure low complexity (LC) and related sequence properties. Composition bias is often associated with LC and disorder, but repeats, while compositionally biased, might also induce ordered structures. We illustrate this dichotomy, and more generally the overlaps between different properties related to LCRs, using examples. We argue that statistical measures alone cannot capture all structural aspects of LCRs and recommend the combined usage of a variety of predictive tools and measurements. While the methodologies available to study LCRs are already very advanced, we foresee that a more comprehensive annotation of sequences in the databases will enable the improvement of predictions and a better understanding of the evolution and the connection between structure and function of LCRs. This will require the use of standards for the generation and exchange of data describing all aspects of LCRs.

When only the sequence (profile) information is used as input feature, currently the best predictors can obtain ∼80% Q3 accuracy, which has not been improved in the past decade. Here we present DeepCNF (Deep Convolutional Neural Fields) for protein SS prediction. DeepCNF is a Deep Learning extension of Conditional Neural Fields (CNF), which is an integration of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and shallow neural networks. DeepCNF can model not only complex sequence-structure relationship by a deep hierarchical architecture, but also interdependency between adjacent SS labels, so it is much more powerful than CNF. Experimental results show that DeepCNF can obtain ∼84% Q3 accuracy, ∼85% SOV score, and ∼72% Q8 accuracy, respectively, on the CASP and CAMEO test proteins, greatly outperforming currently popular predictors. As a general framework, DeepCNF can be used to predict other protein structure properties such as contact number, disorder regions, and solvent accessibility.},
